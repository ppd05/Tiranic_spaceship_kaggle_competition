Hey Git!

This repository contains my solution to the Spaceship Titanic Kaggle challenge. The notebook covers comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), robust feature engineering, and machine learning modeling.

Key Details:

Model: XGBoost Classifier
Validation Strategy: Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation (5 folds)
Mean Accuracy Score: 0.80313

Summary:
After thorough data preprocessing and feature engineering, I trained an XGBoost model with carefully tuned hyperparameters. The model was evaluated using Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation to ensure robustness and reduce variance due to class imbalance. It achieved a strong average validation accuracy of 0.80313 across all folds. All steps, from preprocessing to modeling, are included for full reproducibility.
